Naming convention:
CERES (v1.0) (observatory data logger)

Meaning (source: Wikipedia):
"Ceres (minor-planet designation 1 Ceres) is the largest 
object in the asteroid belt, which lies between the orbits 
of Mars and Jupiter. It is a ball of rock and ice 950 km 
(590 mi) in diameter, containing a third of the mass of the 
asteroid belt. It is the largest asteroid, and the only dwarf 
planet in the inner Solar System. It was the first asteroid 
to be discovered, on 1 January 1801 by Giuseppe Piazzi in 
Palermo, though at first it was considered to be a planet."
